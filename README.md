# Catalog

[Catalog](https://sebfernandez-catalog.herokuapp.com/) is a webapp where you can organize everything you have watched as movies or series and games you have played all in one place, using [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to perform searches.

This is my very first "big" project as I have done everything on my own. Through out Catalog I have learned how to develop the ideas that come across my mind, implement them and at the same time everything has to be in order and keep working. It was an incredible challenge to me!

[Catalog](https://sebfernandez-catalog.herokuapp.com/) was made with the following technology:
- Python.
  - Flask.
  - SQL Alchemy.
- SQLITE.
- Bootstrap (v5).
